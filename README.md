# AutoLotteryChecker
This PHP script automates the proccess of checking if a lottery number has price every 2 days. Created for personal use, after purchasing an anual bono. This worked for the version of the page "https://www.loteriasyapuestas.es/es/euromillones" of 2016
It sends your number, gets the price value from the page, and sends you the result via email.
